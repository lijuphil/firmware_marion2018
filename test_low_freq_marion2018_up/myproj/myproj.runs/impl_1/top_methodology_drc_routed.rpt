2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-1#1 Warning
Clock Net has non-BUF driver and too many loads  
Clock net test_low_freq_marion2018_up_snap_adc/frame_clk is not driven by a Clock Buffer and has more than 512 loads. Driver(s): test_low_freq_marion2018_up_snap_adc/frame_clk_reg/Q
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer
