REQP-1839#16 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 adc16_wb_ram1/bram_inst/symmetric_ram.bram_inst/RAM_reg has an input control pin adc16_wb_ram1/bram_inst/symmetric_ram.bram_inst/RAM_reg/ADDRBWRADDR[11] (net: adc16_wb_ram1/bram_inst/symmetric_ram.bram_inst/s_snap_counter_reg[9][6]) which is driven by a register (test_low_freq_marion2018_up_snap_adc/s_snap_counter_reg[6]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
